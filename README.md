## How to run your own

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/dpellier/github-board
cd github-board
npm install
```

### OAuth configuration

Do not commit the following files in a public repo !

#### Login configuration

In order to allow user to connect with their GitHub account you have to create a SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION auth0 client.

Then create a `.env` file at the root of the project

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<generated auth0 spa client ID>
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<auth0 client domain>
API_URL=<your local api url>
```

#### Identity Provider configuration

In order to allow the app to discuss with the GitHub API you have to create a NON INTERACTIVE auth0 client.

Then create a `.env` file inside the `server` directory.

```
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<generated auth0 non interactive client ID>
AUTH0_SECRET=<generated auth0 non interactive client secret>
```
